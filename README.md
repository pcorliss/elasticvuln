# Elastic Vuln Checker

Demo: http://damp-beyond-8999.herokuapp.com/

### Description

Quick tool to check if an ElasticSearch host is vulnerable to script
injection. Provide the hostname or IP address in the input box and then
check.

You'll receive results back like the following if successful. Or an
error in the network console if the jsonp request fails.

```
107.22.XXX.ZZZ

hostname -f

ip-10-6-YYY-XX.ec2.internal

whoami

elasticsearch
```
